Hi,

For some reason my IDE places my .java files ansd my .class files in seperate directories.
My .class files can be found at "FaceViewer/out/production/FaceViewer". The source sode 
for this assignment can be found at "FaceViewer/src". I'm looking into how I can get everything 
into one common spot. In the future I can move them if you wish.
